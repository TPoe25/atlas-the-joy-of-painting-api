# Bob Ross API project

## Using different languages to work together to modify, transfer, and save things to database.

Solving problem using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
which is the process of taking data from many unique sources, modify in some way, and store it in centralized database.

Common Practice when collecting data from sysytems to utilize that data in another system. Could be CSV, JSON, XML, and API requests, etc.

Will build up README as I read thru the project and add pictures and examples.
